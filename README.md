# sudoRun

So, this is what We ( Aditya Jain, Vineet Shah and Me) created at our first Hackathon. Code-n-counter at Nagarro was an amazing experience. We learnt a lot of things! We will cherish this experience forever. Love for Nagarro! <3 

And, yes, no doubling for the complete documentation of the project link. Find it here :  https://github.com/mohtamohit/sudoRun/blob/master/README.pdf

We have also made an introductory video for the project. Find it here: https://youtu.be/8lQwadx5UTE
